### About Kikuo

I, Kikuo, am not enthusiastic only about coding but the entire software development life cycle.

You can count on me if you would like to realize your idea as a minimum viable product (MVP).
I have experience in the following fields,
- Frontend development specifically with
    - [Vue](https://vuejs.org) (web apps)
    - [React](https://reactjs.org) (web apps)
    - [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) (iOS and Android apps)
- Backend development with [serverless technologies](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) like
    - [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
    - [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
    - [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
- Infrastructure as code (IaC) specifically with [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)

Why are the above experiences vital for MVP development?
- MVP development goes back and forth between frontend and backend matters.
  So having a person with **expertise in both fields is crucial** for timely delivery and success.
- MVP development is not usually well-funded.
  As serverless technologies allow you to start from **zero to very low cost**, they should fit your budget.
- MVP is not a prototype but a product, and **quality still matters**.
  IaC is a key to achieving both quality and quick delivery.

I have been maintaining a UI framework [Buefy](https://buefy.org), and working hard to [modernize it](https://github.com/ntohq/buefy-next) since July 2023.

Learning is my essential quality.
I am currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), and have reached the stage that I can write practical code in Rust.

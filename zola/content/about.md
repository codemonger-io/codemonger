### About Kikuo

I, Kikuo, am enthusiastic about the entire software development life cycle not only coding.

You can count on me if you would like to realize your idea as a minimum viable product (MVP).
I have experience in the following fields,
- Frontend development specifically with
    - [Vue](https://vuejs.org) (web apps)
    - [React](https://reactjs.org) (web apps)
    - [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) (iOS and Android apps)
- Backend development with [serverless technologies](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) like
    - [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
    - [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
    - [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
- Infrastructure as code (IaC) specifically with [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)

Why are the above experiences vital for MVP development?
- MVP development goes back and forth between frontend and backend matters.
  So having a person with **expertise in both fields is crucial** for timely delivery and success.
- MVP development is not usually well-funded.
  As serverless technologies allow you to start from **zero to very low cost**, they should fit your budget.
- MVP is not a prototype but a product, and **quality still matters**.
  IaC is a key to achieving both quality and quick delivery.

I am also a learner, currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
